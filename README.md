# 0. Introduciton
**🔥First released** implementation of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transformation.  It's open-sourced and under MIT License to be used free.

The **Wavelet Transformation** is getting hotter these days in CV and Series-Analysis, DTCWT is a kind of modification of DWT(Discrete Wavelet Transformation) which contains more orientational details in the high-frequence. Process of DT-CWT is as follows:

Thanks to those works mentioned below, our implementation is supported by torch, which can be computed fast and accelerated by GPUs.

💡**You can now use this function in your own work, it may helps a lot, especially in the aspect of medical images with high-resolution and 3 dimensions.** 

### Suggestions in your own work:
We provide some useful-or-not **suggestions** you can deliver this transform:

1. **Scalar Aspects**: wavelet transform
2. 
3. 
*👀Looking forward to updates......👀*

**🚀🚀🚀 Please do not forget to cite our work if you use this implementation! It's really important tu us and we will really appreciate it! 🚀🚀🚀**

**🛰️🛰️🛰️ If you have any suggestions about this repo, pls contact me with my email that posted on my pofile, I will response it as quickly as possible. 🛰️🛰️🛰️**

**🔥🔥🔥 Furthermore, I'm a postgraduate student focusing on CV and Multi-Modality Model, if you have some interest in me or you'd like to find someone to cooperate with in some wonderful projects, do contact me with no doubt. I'm looking for some projects(or PhD Projects with funding) on Robotics or just-DeepLearning🔥🔥🔥**



# 1. Installation
You can follow these steps to a quick installation, it will help you construct your enterpreter. **We highly recommend you create a new environment for it of Annaconda or Miniconda**:
```
git clone https://github.com/YaoxinHuang/3D-DTCWT.git
cd 3d-dtcwt
pip install -e .
